Launching applications via XBMC isn't as easy as it should be.
There's a few problems that this project aims to overcome.

It's primarily for personal use and was hurried out one afternoon so probably won't work on your setup without editing every file.
I had hoped to use a single file with intelligent variables that would take the filename from %1% and determine what to do from there, but things didn't work out how they should.

There's always next time!
